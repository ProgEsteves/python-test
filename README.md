# Python Test

Welcome to the CINQ hiring test for Python developers. Please **fork** this repository and submit a **pull** **request** once you have finished this set of coding challenges.

This test will be about code clarity, problem solving and understanding of the Python language. Please preferably use Python 3 instead Python 2, if you don't know why, you shouldn't take this test.

When reviewing your code we are going to focus at code consistency, clarity and coherence.

## Dependencies

* Python 3 preferably
* NumPy package

## Solving the tests

Each folder stands for a challenge with a 'readme.txt' file explaining what needs to be done and what are the constraints.
